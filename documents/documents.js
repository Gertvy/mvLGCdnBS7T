Hopefully, this article can just be linked to when needing a quick explanation of movers.\nThis article is about movers and auto movers in regular Rolling Sky. Mechanics vary in Rolling Sky Remake.\nYou are expected to have at least a basic understanding of Rolling Sky Tilemaps.",segments:[{title:"How does a mover work?",description:"When the arrow of the mover is touched by the ball, the platform moves one unit in the direction of the mover arrow."},{title:"How does an auto mover work?",description:"When any mover or auto mover next to the auto mover is activated, the auto mover also becomes activated and moves in the direction of the arrow."},{title:"How do I make a mover?",description:"To make a mover in a tilemap, you place a mover arrow tile. You surround the arrow with regular ground tiles. The mover arrow will automatically generate a platform using the ground tiles next to it. This applies to both regular movers and auto movers.\n\nTilesets can vary, so tiles may look different, but in my tileset, tiles with red borders can stop movers from spreading. These red-bordered tiles are called mover separators. The mover arrow can spread to the mover separator, but only on sides that do not have a red border on them, which means you can use the mover separators to section off a mover so it doesn't connect to the rest of your level. Some auto movers in my tileset also have a border on them, and the sides where there are borders will not connect to any normal tiles. Start Ground acts like a top red mover separator, which means it will section off movers if they reach it from above and allow movers to connect if they reach it from below.\n\nThe mover texture will automatically be calculated, so you do not need to worry about it."},{title:"More Info",description:"If you have any questions about how movers work, please contact me on Discord at sqdl_#8597.
